    <p style = "font-size: 20px"> <b>5:11pm 2/16/2021</b> Tanmoy and I came up with the idea for this website.</p>
    <p style = "font-size: 20px"> <b>5:22pm 2/16/2021</b> Fuchsia was chosen by Tanmoy as a theme color.</p>
    <p style = "font-size: 20px"> <b>5:23pm 2/16/2021</b> Burgundy was chosen by Sharmin as a theme color.</p>
    <p style = "font-size: 20px"> <b> 2/20/2021</b> I decided to use a nav bar instead of 4 div boxes in the head of page. The nav bar was separated into
        4 sections, representing each year and then each had a drop down menu for the semesters. </p>
