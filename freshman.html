        <h3> September 8</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Garamond; margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 1%"> September 8th is my birthday!!
            It was a Tuesday so I still had school but it was only two classes so it was all good. I spent the day at 
            my best friend, Sharmin's house. We went to all of our classes together but did we pay attention? 
            Of course not! I was opening gifts and we were just talking and playing games. After our classes 
            we ate lunch that her mom cooked (it was so good!) and watched the office. For the rest of the day we chilled, 
            took selfies, and played monopoly. </p>

        <h3> September 12</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Garamond; margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 1%"> This was the Saturday after
            my birthday so I spent the day celebrating out with my two friends, Sharmin and Mahrukh. This day had a packed
            schedule but it was super fun. First we all met up at the bus stop and the first place we went was <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/psychic-readings-by-vienna-bay-ridge" >psychic readings by Vienna</a>. 
            None of us believed in psychic readings but we thought it would be fun. When we got there, we started to
            get a little scared but the woman was very nice. Mahrukh was too scared to get a reading so only Sharmin and I did it.
            Sharmin got a palm reading and I got a face reading. When we left, I wrote the fortune down in my notes just so I could
            look back at it and see if anything she said really did happen. The next thing we had to do was go to a tattoo shop.
            Since I was now 18, it was no longer illegal for me to get a tattoo! I made an appointment at <a href="https://sunset-park-tattoo-studio.business.site/" >sunset park tattoo studio</a>
            so after the psychic reading, we took the train to the tattoo studio. On the way, we had a small photoshoot in the train
            and train station. We still had time so we decided to get food before the tattoo. Sharmin and I got tacos and Mahrukh got a
            burrito. To be honest, the food was not that good (the radishes were the best part!). Finally it was time for the tattoo. I 
            got the word "8TEEN" on the middle of my back. It was a very quick process and it didn't hurt at all! After the tattoo we went
            for dessert at <a href="http://www.jpetalnyack.com/" >J Petal</a>, a place that sells Japanese crepes and Thai ice cream. 
            We all got ice cream and went to sunset park to eat it. We spread a blanket, chilled, took selfies, and just talked. Then we 
            all took the bus home and rested because it was a fun but busy day!!</p>
