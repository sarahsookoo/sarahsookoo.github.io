        <h3> September 8</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Garamond; margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 0%"> September 8th is my birthday!!
            It was a Tuesday so I still had school but it was only two classes so it was all good. I spent the day at 
            my best friend, Sharmin's house. We went to all of our classes together but did we pay attention? 
            Of course not! I was opening gifts and we were just talking and playing games. After our classes 
            we ate lunch that her mom cooked (it was so good!) and watched the office. For the rest of the day we chilled, 
            took selfies, and played monopoly. </p>

        <h3> September 12</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Garamond; margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 0%"> This was the Saturday after
            my birthday so I spent the day celebrating out with my two friends, Sharmin and Mahrukh.
