            It was a Tuesday so I still had school but it was only two classes so it was all good. I spent the day at
            my best friend, Sharmin's house. We went to all of our classes together but did we pay attention?
            Of course not! I was opening gifts and we were just talking and playing games. After our classes
            we ate lunch that her mom cooked (it was so good!) and watched the office. For the rest of the day we
            chilled, took selfies, and played monopoly.

    <p style=" text-align: center;"> This was
        the Saturday after my birthday so I spent the day celebrating out with my two friends, Sharmin and Mahrukh. This
        day had a packed
        schedule but it was super fun. First we all met up at the bus stop and the first place we went was <a
            href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/psychic-readings-by-vienna-bay-ridge">psychic readings by Vienna</a>.
        None of us believed in psychic readings but we thought it would be fun. When we got there, we started to
        get a little scared but the woman was very nice. Mahrukh was too scared to get a reading so only Sharmin and I
        did it. Sharmin got a palm reading and I got a face reading. When we left, I wrote the fortune down in my notes
        just so
        I could look back at it and see if anything she said really did happen. The next thing we had to do was go to a
        tattoo
        shop. Since I was now 18, it was no longer illegal for me to get a tattoo! I made an appointment at <a
            href="https://sunset-park-tattoo-studio.business.site/">sunset park tattoo studio</a>
        so after the psychic reading, we took the train to the tattoo studio. On the way, we had a small photoshoot in
        the train and train station. We still had time so we decided to get food before the tattoo. Sharmin and I got
        tacos and
        Mahrukh got a burrito. To be honest, the food was not that good (the radishes were the best part!). Finally it
        was time for
        the tattoo. I got the word "8TEEN" on the middle of my back. It was a very quick process and it didn't hurt at
        all! After the
        tattoo we went for dessert at <a href="http://www.jpetalnyack.com/">J Petal</a>, a place that sells Japanese
        crepes and Thai
        ice cream. We all got ice cream and went to sunset park to eat it. We spread a blanket, chilled, took selfies,
        and just
        talked. Then we all took the bus home and rested because it was a fun but busy day!!</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 5%;">October
        17th is Sharmin's birthday!! Her birthday conveniently fell on a Saturday so we were able to hang out. First we
        took the train to
        <a href="http://www.paesanosoflittleitaly.com/">Paesano</a>, an Italian restaurant. Their food was really good,
        I highly recommend. The restaurant was near Washington Square Park so we walked there to take photos and relax.
        When we got there, there was a dog park so I had to stand and watch the cute doggies for a good 5 minutes!! Then
        we got
        to the middle of the park and took photos. After that, we found a nice bench and just sat and talked. Then we
        went to
        <a href="https://www.lanewyorkina.com/">La NewYorkina</a>, an ice cream shop. We both got chocolate ice cream!
        We then took the train home and chilled.

    <p>My mom, brother and I decided
        to vote early. When we got to our voting site the line was about 5 blocks long! I
        was ready to go back home but my mom made me stay because she said the line would be that long everyday. Half
        way through the 5 blocks, I called Sharmin and told her to come join us in the line so she wouldn't have to wait
        too
        long. And also to bring water and snacks <span> &#128522;</span>. When she got there, we were only one block away. It was about a 2
        hour wait in total! Once we got in the voting site, we had to show our IDs and get the ballot. Then we went to
        the
        little booths to bubble in our answers. We handed in the completed ballots and that was it! We had just voted!!
        It was
        a very simple and easy process and the 2 hours wait time was definitely worth it. </p>

    <p> This day, my now boyfriend,
        Tanmoy, and I hung out. We were just friends at the time and were meeting for the first time. We met up at the
        train station and
        walked to <a href="https://hudsonriverpark.org/">Hudson River Park</a> where we just killed time by walking and
        talking. I must say, we vibed really well and I already knew it was going to be a good day. We had tickets to
        the <a href="https://whitney.org/">Whitney
            Museum of American Art</a> for 12:15pm so when the time came we headed over there. I was an interesting
        museum that had all kinds of art, some of which
        we appreciated and some, well not really. Later that day we also had reserved a time to walk the <a
            href="https://www.thehighline.org/">highline</a>. I've always wanted to walk the highline and surprisingly,
        so did he! It was long but calming and peaceful walk. We talked
        about literally everything! At the end of the highline is <a href="https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/">Hudson
            Yards</a>. We went to Hudson Yards Mall, visited some stores, and bought food at Shake Shack. We ate the
        food outside and after some more strolling around, we went home.

    <p style="text-align:center;"> Sharmin came over to help
        with Thanksgiving preps and to help put up the Christmas tree on this day! It was a Tuesday so I still had class
        but it left early. My brother and I went to pick Sharmin up from her house and she got 2 pizza pies for the whole
        family to have for dinner. Once we arrived home, we got to work. We went to the attic and brought down the Christmas tree,
        the ornaments, garland, and so much more decorations. We set up the tree, put on some music and started to place the 
        ornaments. It was really fun and calming. We put up all the other decorations around the house and then got started 
        on the turkey. First the turkey had to soak for some hours so we filled up the basement sink and put the turkey in there.
        That was such a difficult and funny process because neither of us had ever done that before. We decided to take a break 
        and have a photoshoot until my mom came home. Once my mom got home, she got us started with the cooking preps. She gave us
        no breaks other than to eat dinner which we took advantage of <span> &#128522;</span>. Later that day we dropped Sharmin back home. She was
        such a great help to my family and I during the holidays!

    <p style="padding-top: 3%; text-align: center; padding-bottom: 5%;"> On this day Tanmoy and I hung 
        out for the second time and this was also the day that we started dating! <span style="color: rgb(226, 23, 23);">&#10084;</span> First we met up at the train station
        and then walked to <a href="https://theshopsatskyviewny.com/">The Shops at SkyView Center</a>. We walked around
        there and went to a couple stores so we could kill time waiting for the pool hall to open. Once it was time, we
        walked over to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/prince-billiards-flushing">Prince Billiards</a> to play pool. 
        We played 3 games and oof did he look hot while playing them. While we played, he also helped me, because it was 
        not only about winning, but also about learning. Then we went to get food. We chilled, talked, and ate until it
        was time to part ways. He walked me to the train station and he went to take the bus. It was a really good day
        and I had so much fun. </p>
