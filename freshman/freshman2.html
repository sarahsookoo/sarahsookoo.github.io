        <p style="padding-top: 3%;"> On this day Tanmoy and I hung out. We planned to go to Queens Center Mall and since we were both transfering
        to the R train we decided to meet up at the transfer point. Our timings was perfect as we both got at the R train
        platform at the same time and the train didn't come much later. Once we got to the mall, we walked around, talked, 
        and shopped. Then we went down to the food court at McDonalds and bought chicken nuggets. We had to eat them outside
        because outdoor dining was not being offered. It was so chaotic because it was freezing cold, I was dying of laughter,
        and tears were coming out of my eyes all while trying to eat chicken nuggets. We went back inside the mall when were 
        done and warmed up. We then went to Taco Bell because Tanmoy wanted me to try their nacho fries. They were really good!
        We went back to mall to warm up and walk around stores again. Somehow Tanmoy was hungry again so he got food 
        and we shared it. Then we both went to the train station to be on our way home.
