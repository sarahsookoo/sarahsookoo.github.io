        <p style="padding-top: 2.5%;"> On this day Tanmoy and I hung out. We planned to go to <a href="https://www.shopqueenscenter.com/">Queens Center Mall</a> and since we were both transferring
        to the R train we decided to meet up at the transfer point. Our timings was perfect as we both got at the R train
        platform at the same time and the train didn't come much later. Once we got to the mall, we walked around, talked, 
        and shopped. Then we went down to the food court at McDonalds and bought chicken nuggets. We had to eat them outside
        because outdoor dining was not being offered. It was so chaotic because it was freezing cold, I was dying of laughter,
        and tears were coming out of my eyes all while trying to eat chicken nuggets. We went back inside the mall when were 
        done and warmed up. We then went to Taco Bell because Tanmoy wanted me to try their nacho fries. They were really good!
        We went back to mall to warm up and walk around stores again. Somehow Tanmoy was hungry again so he got food at <a href="https://www.sarkujapan.com/">Sarku Japan </a>
        and we shared it. When we were done eating, we exchanged Valentines Day gifts.<span style="color: rgb(226, 23, 23);">&#10084;</span> Then we both went to the train station to be on our way home.

        <p style=" padding-top: 1%;"> On this day I hung out with Tanmoy and some of his friends. Tanmoy and I decided to meet up at Grand Central
        Station and then travel to Queens together from there. Once we got off the train at Mets Willis Station, we walked
        to the unisphere which is where everyone was meeting up. All of his friends were already there. We all chilled for a while
        and took some group photos. Then we found our way to <a href="https://queensmuseum.org/">Queens museum</a>. Overall the museum seemed to have no point except for its 
        panorama of the City of New York. It had the entire blueprint of New York City and there was such beautiful details. Then 
        we walked over to <a href="https://queenszoo.com/">Queens Zoo</a>. The zoo was so fun, especially the petting zoo!! The animals were so cute and friendly. After the 
        zoo, we went to get food which was about a 30 minute walk. We all ate food and then Tanmoy and I went to <a href="https://www.kungfutea.com/">Kung Fu Tea</a> for bubble tea.
        I had to leave early, around 5:30 because I had a 2 hour travel home but overall it was a really fun day!! </p>

          <p> Tanmoy and I planned to have a food day this day. We met up at Penn Station at around 10:30. Our first food
            stop was at Rose Pizza and Pasta. Their pizza is amazing and probably the best in NYC and I really wanted Tanmoy
            to try it. But when we got there, we couldn't find Rose Pizza and when we asked, apparently they closed down. That
            was so sad. We exited the train station and found another pizza shop. We both got a buffalo slice and surprisingly it tasted
            just like Rose Pizza's and their shop had the same aesthetic so I think maybe they're the same workers. That pizza was really
            good. Then while we were there we exchanged light switch covers. I painted the one I had for him and then he gave me his blank one.
            He really liked the painting and that made me very happy <span> &#128522;</span>. Next we made our way to our next food stop which was <a href="https://gogocurryamerica.com/">Go Go Curry</a>.
            We bought one meal and shared it. It was my first time trying it and it actually wasn't that bad. I liked it but it was loaded with
            salt. Then we walked to <a href="https://www.mms.com/en-us/experience-mms/mms-world-stores">M&M world</a>. Literally everything there has something to do with M&Ms. We each filled a bag with one of a kind 
            M&Ms and bought it. Our next stop was <a href="https://www.gongchausa.com/">Gong Cha</a> where we bought a strawberry milk bubble tea and shared it. It actually
            tasted better than I expected. Next we walked to Central Park and had a picnic! We laid down a blanket and just chilled, talked,
            ate chips, kissed and laughed <span> &#128522;</span>. Our last stop was a Halal truck. We both got chicken kebabs and ate them on the steps of Columbus
            Circle. Once we were finished, we found our way to the train station and parted ways. It was such a fun day and I was genuinely happy.

        <p> Sharmin and I went to the <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/">Brookyln Museum</a> on this day. We got tickets for 11:15. We met up at the train station at
        10:30 and it was only a 30 minute travel there. We were a bit ahead schedule since we got there at around 10:50. We walked
        around the area to kill time and just talked about life. As 11:15 came closer, we found our way to the museum. The museum had a 
        lot of art and sculptures. We also had a whole photoshoot in the middle of the museum and decided what we were
        going to do afterwards. That was fun. Then we walked around the museum and explored all the art. When we left we made our
        way to <a href="http://www.brooklynburgersandbeer.com/">Brooklyn Burgers and Beers</a> which is where we had lunch. We chose that restaurant because it was just across the 
        street from a thrift shop. The food was pretty good and the prices were reasonable. When we were done, we crossed the street
        to the <a href="https://www.housingworks.org/">Housing Works Thrift Shop</a>. It was a small shop and to be honest, they were kind of overpriced for a thrift shop.
        When we were done there, we looked for other thrift shops in the area and we found <a href="https://www.ltrainvintagenyc.com/">L Train Vintage</a> was only 9 minutes away.
        We walked there and Sharmin found some nice pieces there. Again, we had no plans after that so we looked on the map and 
        there was a playground nearby. We walked there, found a bench, and just chilled. Tanmoy and I planned to post on Instagram
        together at 4. During the process of trying to post and sharing my hotspot with Sharmin, my phone died, so that was unfortunate.
        We decided to go home after all that chaos. Overall, it was a relaxed and spontaneous day.

        <p style="padding-top: 1%;"> Today Sharmin and I decided to go out and have a work day. We went to <a href="https://coffeeprojectny.com/">Coffee Project New York</a> in Fort Greene. 
          We traveled there on our own and met up there. In order to dine in, you need to purchase something, so I got an iced coffee. We found a seat, got the WiFi password and
          got to work. I worked on my English essay while Sharmin worked on some things for her art class. The cafe was playing their music
          kind of loud and Sharmin couldn't concentrate so she switched to looking up classes and electives at Brookyln College. After a 
          couple hours we left and went to <a href="https://www.downtownbrooklyn.com/listings/atlantic-terminal-mall-plaza">Atlantic Terminal Mall</a>. We
          visited almost every store in the mall including Target, Bath and Body Works, Marshalls, Burlington, Party City, and Old Navy. When we were
          done shopping we left the mall and found a bench to chill out. Then we found the train station and were on our way home!
