        <p style="padding-top: 3%;"> On this day Tanmoy and I hung out. We planned to go to Queens Center Mall and since we were both transferring
        to the R train we decided to meet up at the transfer point. Our timings was perfect as we both got at the R train
        platform at the same time and the train didn't come much later. Once we got to the mall, we walked around, talked, 
        and shopped. Then we went down to the food court at McDonalds and bought chicken nuggets. We had to eat them outside
        because outdoor dining was not being offered. It was so chaotic because it was freezing cold, I was dying of laughter,
        and tears were coming out of my eyes all while trying to eat chicken nuggets. We went back inside the mall when were 
        done and warmed up. We then went to Taco Bell because Tanmoy wanted me to try their nacho fries. They were really good!
        We went back to mall to warm up and walk around stores again. Somehow Tanmoy was hungry again so he got food 
        and we shared it. When we were done eating, we exchanged Valentines Day gifts.<span style="color: rgb(226, 23, 23);">&#10084;</span> Then we both went to the train station to be on our way home.

        <p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1%;"> On this day I hung out with Tanmoy and some of his friends. Tanmoy and I decided to meet up at Grand Central
        Station and then travel to Queens together from there. Once we got off the train at Mets Willis Station, we walked
        to the unisphere which is where everyone was meeting up. All of his friends were already there. We all chilled for a while
        and took some group photos. Then we found our way to Queens museum. Overall the museum seemed to have no point except for its 
        panorama of the City of New York. It had the entire blueprint of New York City and there was such beautiful details. Then 
        we walked over to Queens Zoo. The zoo was so fun, especially the petting zoo!! The animals were so cute and friendly. After the 
        zoo, we went to get food which was about a 30 minute walk. We all ate food and then Tanmoy and I went to Kung Fu Tea for bubble tea.
        I had to leave early, around 5:30 because I had a 2 hour travel home but overall it was a really fun day!! </p>

          <p> Tanmoy and I planned to have a food day this day. We met up at Penn Station at around 10:30. Our first food
            stop was at Rose Pizza and Pasta. Their pizza is amazing and probably the best in NYC and I really wanted Tanmoy
            to try it. But when we got there, we couldn't find Rose Pizza and when we asked, apparently they closed down. That
            was so sad. We exited the train station and found another pizza shop. We both got a buffalo slice and surprisingly it tasted
            just like Rose Pizza's and their shop had the same aesthetic so I think maybe they're the same workers. That pizza was really
            good. Then while we were there we exchanged light switch covers. I painted the one I had for him and then he gave me his blank one.
            He really liked the painting and that made me very happy <span> &#128522;</span>. Next we made our way to our next food stop which was Go Go Curry.
            We bought one meal and shared it. It was my first time trying it and it actually wasn't that bad. I liked it but it was loaded with
            salt. Then we walked to M&M world. Literally everything there has something to do with M&Ms. We each filled a bag with one of a kind 
            M&Ms and bought it. Our next stop was Gong Cha where we bought a strawberry milk bubble tea and shared it. It actually
            tasted better than I expected. Next we walked to Central Park and had a picnic! We laid down a blanket and just chilled, talked,
            ate chips, kissed and laughed <span> &#128522;</span>. Our last stop was the Halal truck. We both got chicken kebabs and ate them on the steps of Columbus
            Circle. Once we were finished, we found our way to the train station and parted ways. It was such a fun day and I was genuinely happy.
