<p style= "padding-top: 0%;"> Sharmin and I have a tradition where we hang out the day after Christmas. This year we
created vision baords. We bought a poster board and printed out photos of things we expected and hoped for in the
new year. During this time, I lost wifi at my home for about 3 days so getting to go to Sharmin's house and finally 
get some internet was great! Once I got there we put on some music, laid everything out, and got to work. Sharmin's mom
also made me ramen because I didn't eat breakfast beforehand. It took about an hour to finish our vision boards. When we
were done, we chilled and took selfies. Then we got ready to go to Barnes and Noble. We mainly looked at poem books 
because we were planning on doing a project with them for each other. Afterwards, we went back to Sharmin's house and ate
lunch that her mom cooked. We chilled out for a bit again and then I was on my way back to a wifi-less home! </p>

<!-- Went over to Sharmins house, vision boards, barnes and noble, no wifi -->
