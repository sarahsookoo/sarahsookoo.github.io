<p style= "padding-top: 0%; text-align: center;"> Sharmin and I have a tradition where we hang out the day after Christmas. This year we
created vision baords. We bought a poster board and printed out photos of things we expected and hoped for in the
new year. During this time, I lost wifi at my home for about 3 days so getting to go to Sharmin's house and finally 
get some internet was great! Once I got there we put on some music, laid everything out, and got to work. Sharmin's mom
also made me ramen because I didn't eat breakfast beforehand. It took about an hour to finish our vision boards. When we
were done, we chilled and took selfies. Then we got ready to go to Barnes and Noble. We mainly looked at poem books 
because we were planning on doing a project with them for each other. Afterwards, we went back to Sharmin's house and ate
lunch that her mom cooked. We chilled out for a bit again and then I was on my way back to a wifi-less home! </p>

<p> These three weeks I participated in a winternship at Cognizant. Cognizant is a company that develops softwares and portals
and sells them to health care and insurance companies. There was about 15 winterns in total and they split us up into groups of 
3 or 4 to complete out project. My groups project was to create a help button and implement it in all of their links and forms.
When the help button is pressed it reveals contextual help on how to fill out forms and what information is needed. This is most
helpful for older users, those who are not technically advanced, and to provide defitions for medical terms. The first week of 
the winternship was mainly meetings, presentations and product demos. Each day we met people from different departments and had
panel boards where we were able to ask questions. Later in the day for an hour, we would meet with the techical team and become 
familiar with their code. The second week was mainly the same but we spent three hours with the techical team and software developers.
This was also the week that we started coding and testing things out. The third and final week was all coding, powerpoint
making and practicing for the presentation. Overall, the 3 weeks was super stressful, busy and had a lot of sprint coding but
I learned so much and gained a lot of experience in a professional coding environment.

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 3%;"> My winternship was finally over so Sharmin and I decided to hang out again. We planned to go thrift shopping 
at Buffalo Exchange in downtown Brooklyn. We got there kind of early so we walked in Sephora and Barnes and Noble for some time.
Once the thrift shop opened, we were the first ones in. They had some pretty nice clothes and accessories but I would say they
were a bit overpriced. We could have gotten nicer things at better stores for cheaper prices. Despite that, we were both able
to pick out some nice things. When we left the thrift shop, it had started snowing so we decided to have a small photoshoot in the
snow but we got cold pretty quickly. Then we started looking for a restaurant where we could eat lunch but we were unsuccessful
because all the places had outdoor dining and there was no way we were eating in the snow. So we took the train back to Sharmin's house.
We got food there and watched How to get Away with Murder while eating. Then we just chilled until it got late and I was on
my way home.
