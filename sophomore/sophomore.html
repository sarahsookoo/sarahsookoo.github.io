        <p> Today was my first day of having to go to work and then go to school. I went to work from
            8-12. There was no one else in the office and I didn't get that much work. I finished up all the work that 
            I got and then spent the remaining time studying for my classes. I had a really good and productive study session
            so I think that's what I'm going to do from now on when I don't have anything to do in work. After work I had to get
            to school for 12:45 for my class. On schedule builder, it says that class is in person but the professor is doing it 
            all online. I still went to campus today, though, because I wanted to go to the club fair that Hunter was having afterwards.
            So I got to Hunter at around 12:30, found a seat and had my class.</p>

            <p>The professor requires cameras to be on so that is unfortunate. 
            Once class ended, I met up with my friend Anthony again and we went to the street/club fair. To be honest, it was a dub. And our only
            explanation for that is "Hunter". It was very crowded and a lot of the clubs are ethnic related. We walked through the fair and then 
            decided to get food. It was an impromtu decision, as always with us. We found an Italian restaurant called <a href="https://www.donnamargheritany.com/">Donna Margherita</a> 
            so we decided to go there. It was a pretty nice restaurant, authentic Italian. We got our food, ate, talked about some CRAZY 
            stories and people, and then left. Anthony hopped in an uber and I took the train back home. Once again, it was so much fun 
            hanging out with Anthony and it made up for the wack fair.

        <p> Today Mahrukh and I finally went out after almost a year!! We planned to go to <a href="https://www.courtstreettavern.com/">Court Street Tavern</a> because
            the restaurant is sooo cute and I wanted to take photos. We met up at the junction for 12 and then took the B103
            from there. We had a reservation for 2:00 but we got to the restaurant at around 1:30. They still took us though!
            Also, the reservation was for indoor seats because we thought it was going to rain but we really wanted to sit outdoors
            because that's where all the aesthetics are. They let us sit outdoors also! We ordered our food and talked about so much
            stuff. From school and work to drama and gossip. We haven't caught up in so long!!</p>
            <img width="122" height="190" src="photos/tavern.JPG" style="float:right; padding-right: 1%; margin-bottom: .5%;" alt="anthony1">

            <p>We took photos and then left the
            restaurant to get dessert. We saw a snow cone cart while we were walking there and Mahrukh wanted one so that's what we got. 
            We walked and talked some more and went to a playground because Mahrukh wanted to go on the swings. We waited until the kids
            left and swung. I haven't been on a swing in so long, it literally felt like I was flying. We walked around and saw some 
            other really cute restaurants that we want to go to. We took the R and 2 train back to the junction and then we were on our
            way home. It was so great to finally see Mahrukh again, I was not going to make an entire year pass by without me seeing her. </p>

    <p>Today is my birthday!! I spent the day similar to how I spent it last year. First, I had work from 8am-12pm but it was
        remote so I was able to stay home to clock in and out. All my coworkers came together and created an online happy birthday 
        postcard and sent it to me. It was very cute and thoughtful. After work, I had an appointment at Sunset Park Tattoo Studio 
        for 1. I got a tattoo of a cross on the side of my right wrist. I took the b6 and then at the transfer point to the b11,
        Sharmin met me. We took the b11 together to the studio and got the tattoo done right away. Since it was so close to the wrist,
        it hurt a bit. I would give it a 7/10 pain level. Afterwards, we took the b11 back to Sharmin's house. Her mom made gyros which
        is what we also ate last year and one of my favorite foods. Sharmin and I ate the gyros for lunch while watching You on Netflix.
        Then we played the same game that we played before where we were supposed to name all the countries of the world in 15 minutes. We
        did much better than last time so that's good. Next, we played pictionary and a bunch of games on Kahoot based on topics that we 
        both like. We've never done that before but it was super fun because it was always one of us that knew all the answers and one 
        that didn't know any.
