        <p> Today was my first day of having to go to work and then go to school. I went to work from
            8-12. There was no one else in the office and I didn't get that much work. I finished up all the work that
            I got and then spent the remaining time studying for my classes. I had a really good and productive study
            session
            so I think that's what I'm going to do from now on when I don't have anything to do in work. After work I
            had to get
            to school for 12:45 for my class. On schedule builder, it says that class is in person but the professor is
            doing it
            all online. I still went to campus today, though, because I wanted to go to the club fair that Hunter was
            having afterwards.
            So I got to Hunter at around 12:30, found a seat and had my class.</p>

            style="float:left; padding-right: 1%; margin-bottom: .5%;" alt="anthony3">

        <p>The professor requires cameras to be on so that is unfortunate.
            Once class ended, I met up with my friend Anthony again and we went to the street/club fair. To be honest,
            it was a dub. And our only
            explanation for that is "Hunter". It was very crowded and a lot of the clubs are ethnic related. We walked
            through the fair and then
            decided to get food. It was an impromtu decision, as always with us. We found an Italian restaurant called
            <a href="https://www.donnamargheritany.com/">Donna Margherita</a>
            so we decided to go there. It was a pretty nice restaurant, authentic Italian. We got our food, ate, talked
            about some CRAZY
            stories and people, and then left. Anthony hopped in an uber and I took the train back home. Once again, it
            was so much fun
            hanging out with Anthony and it made up for the wack fair.

        <p> Today Mahrukh and I finally went out after almost a year!! We planned to go to <a
                href="https://www.courtstreettavern.com/">Court Street Tavern</a> because
            the restaurant is sooo cute and I wanted to take photos. We met up at the junction for 12 and then took the
            B103
            from there. We had a reservation for 2:00 but we got to the restaurant at around 1:30. They still took us
            though!
            Also, the reservation was for indoor seats because we thought it was going to rain but we really wanted to
            sit outdoors
            because that's where all the aesthetics are. They let us sit outdoors also! We ordered our food and talked
            about so much
            stuff. From school and work to drama and gossip. We haven't caught up in so long!!</p>

        <p>We took photos and then left the
            restaurant to get dessert. We saw a snow cone cart while we were walking there and Mahrukh wanted one so
            that's what we got.
            We walked and talked some more and went to a playground because Mahrukh wanted to go on the swings. We
            waited until the kids
            left and swung. I haven't been on a swing in so long, it literally felt like I was flying. We walked around
            and saw some
            other really cute restaurants that we want to go to. We took the R and 2 train back to the junction and then
            we were on our
            way home. It was so great to finally see Mahrukh again, I was not going to make an entire year pass by
            without me seeing her. </p>

        <p>Today is my birthday!! I spent the day similar to how I spent it last year. First, I had work from 8am-12pm
            but it was
            remote so I was able to stay home to clock in and out. All my coworkers came together and created an online
            happy birthday
            postcard and sent it to me. It was very cute and thoughtful. After work, I had an appointment at <a
                href="https://sunset-park-tattoo-studio.business.site/">Sunset Park Tattoo Studio</a>
            for 1. I got a tattoo of a cross on the side of my right wrist. I took the b6 and then at the transfer point
            to the b11,
            Sharmin met me. We took the b11 together to the studio and got the tattoo done right away. Since it was so
            close to the wrist,
            it hurt a bit. I would give it a 7/10 pain level. Afterwards, we took the b11 back to Sharmin's house. Her
            mom made gyros which
            is what we also ate last year and one of my favorite foods. Sharmin and I ate the gyros for lunch while
            watching You on Netflix.
            Then Sharmin gave me my gifts. I got a kolbalish which is a pillow to hug while I sleep. I've always wanted
            one because it's so
            comfortable and I finally got it!! Also, I got a ring from pandora and Sharmin has one too so we're
            matching!
            Then we played the same game that we played before where we were supposed to name all the countries of the
            world in 15 minutes. We
            did much better than last time so that's good. Next, we played pictionary and a bunch of games on Kahoot
            based on topics that we
            both like. We've never done that before but it was super fun because it was always one of us that knew all
            the answers and one
            that didn't know any. After that, we just chilled until my dad came to pick me up. It was a fun day and I
            had a great birthday!

        <p>This day started off very regular shmegular. I had been planning to meet up with Maylyn, one of my friends
            from
            high school but our schedules barely lined up and there were a lot of days off from school. We planned to
            meet
            up yesterday, which was Monday but that was canceled. Today I had work in the morning and then from 12:45pm
            to 2pm
            I have class. The class is online and the Hunter Brookdale campus is right across the street from my job so
            I take the
            class in the library there. I thought it wouldn't be possible to meet up with my friend today because I
            wasn't at the
            main campus but that wasn't the case! Turns out she's dorming at the Brookdale dorms so she was right there.
            We met up
            after my class finished at 2. We had no plan because we didn't even know we were going out. We walked around
            for a bit
            and decided to go to <a href="https://frankstrattoriaonfirst.com/">Franks Trattoria</a> an Italian shop. We
            both got
            pizza and just caught up with each others lives. It was nice seeing her and since she's so close to my job,
            I'll
            definitely be seeing her a lot more!!

        <p> Today was a really long day. I went to work as usual. I spent about an extra hour at work (30 minutes
            earlier and 30
            minutes later) because why not. I've been working a lot of overtime.<span>&#129297;</span> My geology
            professor was planning to have a field
            trip to the gem and mineral exhibition at the museum of natural history as a class for a lab. She was
            planning for it
            to be today so she was gathering the availability of everyone to see if we would have enough people. Enough
            people
            were available so they agreed to meet at the museum at 3 and class was canceled. I was available during that
            time but
            I had work to do, specifically a Spanish asynchronous exam to take. If class wasn't canceled then I don't
            know when I
            would've taken the exam so thank goodness for that. I went to the library at the Hunter Brookdale campus and
            took my exam.
            Pretty chill exam to be honest. Then I had planned to go to the <a href="https://sangennaronyc.org/">Feast
                of San Gennaro</a>
            with a new friend that I made at Hunter, named Karen. The Feast of San Gennaro is an iconic festival in
            Little Italy/Chinatown.
            We met there at around 3. </p>

        <p>The first thing that we got was food because we were both really hungry. There was a lot of
            street food and vendors which are our favorite. We both got these big jumbo shish kebabs and it was amazing,
            just really
            salty. The fair had a couple of rollercoaster and games. We decided to go on the ferris wheel. The dude
            controlling it literally seemed like
            he didn't care at all so we went around a bunch of time. I was kind of sketchy to go on a ferris wheel in
            the middle of Chinatown
            but it was honestly pretty fun and there was a really good view of the festival when we were on top. We
            walked around the fair, got
            gelato and then went to a nearby park. We found a seat and just talked and caught up on each others lives.
            After that, we walked through
            the fair one more time and then were on out way home. We both took the F train and then transferred at our
            respectful stops. It was
            really fun hanging out with Karen, especially since I wanted to go to the Feast of San Gennaro for a long
            time now!!</p>

        <p>Today Sharmin and I decided to go to the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/">American Museum of Natural
                History</a> so that I could
            complete my lab for my geology class. I went to church and to my therapist in the morning and then I was on
            my
            way to the museum. Sharmin met me at Atlantic Avenue on the 2 train. The plan was to take the 2 train to
            72<sup>nd</sup>
            street and then walk to the museum on 81<sup>st</sup> street. But since it was raining, we decided to
            transfer to the C train at
            Times Square and get off at 81<sup>st</sup> which led straight into the museum. However, once we got there,
            to our surprise, they
            weren't letting anyone in through that entrance because of covid. When we went outside, the line to the
            museum went around a block
            and a half and we had to wait on it even though we had a reservation at 2pm. The line moved quickly, though
            and once we were in
            museum, we went to the gems and minerals exhibition first so I could do my lab. I took pictures of a lot of
            the rocks and
            gems, and a lot of</p>

        <p>the explanations that went with it so I would have something to write about. Afterwards, we walked around the
            entire
            museum, there was a bunch of cool stuff. Once we saw all the exhibits, we left the museum and Sharmin wanted
            to go to a nearby flea market. The flea market had a lot of clothes, art and jewelry. It was pretty
            nice but overpriced for a flea market in my opinion. Next, we went to Shake Shack, got some food and just
            talked. Then
            we walked to the train station and were on our way home. It's been a while since Sharmin and I went out so
            it was a good
            and productive day!

        <p> Today was Sharmin's birthday! Happy birthday Sharmin!! The plan was to go bowling and get lunch afterwards.
            Her
            birthday fell on a Sunday so I went to church and to my therapist before going out. Sharmin and I met at the
            Atlantic
            Avenue train station and took the N train together from there. Once we arrived, we waited a bit for Summayya
            to come
            and then we were on our way to <a href="https://melodylanesny.com/">Melody Lanes</a>. We paid for an hour of
            bowling.
            I was on the bowling team in highschool so i was pretty confident that I was going to win. I was winning at
            fist but
            as Sharmin and Summayya started getting the hang of it, they were catching up to me!! Very crazy. Sharmin
            won the first
            game and Summayya won the second. We started a third one but wasn't able to finish because our time ran out.
            Then we
            went to <a href="https://www.princeteahouse.com/">Prince Tea House</a> for lunch. The place was really cute
            and the food
            was pretty good. Also, were really reasonably priced. We ended up getting lunch and dessert because the
            place is actually
            known for their dessert. Afterwards, we went back to the train station to be on our way home. It was still
            pretty early
            so once we got to Atlantic Avenue, Sharmin and Summayya got out and wanted to walk around Atlantic Terminal
            Mall while I
            just transferred to my next train to get home. Bowling made me feel nostalgic but it was a calm and fun
            day!!

    <p>These 5 days I decided to take a trip to Toronto, Canada to take a mental break and visit some of my friends and family.

        <p> Well today was my flight!! The flight was leaving at 10:35am and for international flights they recommend you be
            there at least 3 hours before so everything goes smoothly. So I was aiming for 7:30am. I woke up at 5:30 and left
            home at 6:30. My dad was driving me to Laguardia Airport. Once we got there, we parked up and then went to one of 
            the Air Canada kiosks so I could check in and get my boarding pass. But for some reason, the kiosk kept telling me 
            that my boarding pass couldn't be printed so I had to go wait on line to see an actual person. The line was short, though
            so it was all good. Then once I went up to the representative, I gave her all my stuff and then she asked for my aeroCan
            and I was like "huh?". I didn't have that so I had to step aside, download the app and then fill out all my information in
            order to get a QR code. Then once all that was over, I was able to check in and then I went to the TSA for then to scan and
            check my bags. One of my bags got pulled aside for extra checking. The agent opened it and checked it and then let me go.
            Then I was on my way to the gate. I had my suitcase as a carry on and my duffel bag as a personal item and oof that was a lot to
            carry (I made it tho!). I found gate 49, found a seat and just chilled. It was 9am so I had an hour until boarding at 10. Pretty
            good timing. We started boarding late but still landed ontime at 12:12. My aunt couldn't pick me up at the airport so she sent one
            of her friends, Kathleen, to come pick me up. Once I landed, I texted Kathleen. Before I exited the airport I had to go to 
            border security where they checked my aeroCan and stamped my passport. Then I exited the airport and found Kathleen. It was
            surprisingly a flawless and smooth process in terms of timing and finding her. Then we went to Tim Hortons, got some food, 
            and she dropped me off at my aunt's house. My aunt wasn't coming home until around 4 so I just ate and chilled out. Then
            once she came home, we went to the supermarket to get some snacks and food for me. We also went to the pharmacy to inquire about
            a covid test for when I have to come back home. After that, we came home, showered, ate dinner and then chilled for the rest
            of the day.

        <p> I slept SO well last night. It was like my body knew I was on vacation and that I was waking up to not a care in the world.
            I woke up at around 8 and got out of bed at like 9. I came downstairs, ate some breakfast and then my aunt and I  just chilled.
            We had some really deep conversations about both of our lives. Then we both had lunch. At around 4:30, we left to go pick up
            Kathleen and then we were on our way to downtown Toronto. We drove to scarborough center where we parked the car and went to take
            the train. Their train system is similar to New York but the map is much less simpler because they only have 4 trains. We took 3
            trains to get to downtown Toronto. When we got off the train, our first stop was Nathan Phillip Square because that is where the
            big Toronto sign is. It was dark outside so the sign was lit up and it looked really pretty. We stopped to take pictures of it and 
            with it. Near there is a mall named Eaton Center where we just walked through to see the Christmas decorations. Then we continued 
            walking to a place called Dundas Square which is like New York's Times Square. It was nice and definitely
            did give off that Times Square vibe. Then my aunt wanted to show Kathleen and I her college and its campus. It was literally one block
            away which is crazy because its like her college was smack in the middle of Times Square. The campus was pretty big and I actually liked
            it there. Then while we were walking, we saw this little section with a bunch of food carts and street fair. We stopped there and Kathleen
            got Brazilian food, my aunt got falafel and I got poutine. I tried poutine the last time I went to Canada and I loved it so I had to get it
            again. We sat and ate and then we went back to the train station to go to the CN Tower. The CN tower is like Canada's 
            monument. Once we got out of the train station, it had gotten SO cold and windy. We went to the CN tower and walked through the 
            skywalk/bridge and then that linked us to the train station again. Before the station was a kind of mini museum so we walked through
            there and then hopped on the train. We got back to the car, dropped Kathleen home and then went home. The day may have started late but
            it was definitely packed and fun.
