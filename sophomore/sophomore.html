        <p> Today was my first day of having to go to work and then go to school. I went to work from
            8-12. There was no one else in the office and I didn't get that much work. I finished up all the work that 
            I got and then spent the remaining time studying for my classes. I had a really good and productive study session
            so I think that's what I'm going to do from now on when I don't have anything to do in work. After work I had to get
            to school for 12:45 for my class. On schedule builder, it says that class is in person but the professor is doing it 
            all online. I still went to campus today, though, because I wanted to go to the club fair that Hunter was having afterwards.
            So I got to Hunter at around 12:30, found a seat and had my class.</p>

            <p>The professor requires cameras to be on so that is unfortunate. 
            Once class ended, I met up with my friend Anthony again and we went to the street/club fair. To be honest, it was a dub. And our only
            explanation for that is "Hunter". It was very crowded and a lot of the clubs are ethnic related. We walked through the fair and then 
            decided to get food. It was an impromtu decision, as always with us. We found an Italian restaurant called Donna Margherita 
            so we decided to go there. It was a pretty nice restaurant, authentic Italian. We got our food, ate, talked about some CRAZY 
            stories and people, and then left. Anthony hopped in an uber and I took the train back home. Once again, it was so much fun 
            hanging out with Anthony and it made up for the wack fair.
