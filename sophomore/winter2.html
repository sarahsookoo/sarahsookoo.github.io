        <p>Sharmin and I have a tradition where we always do something on the day after Christmas. Last year we made vision boards
            and we really like it so this year we decided to continue. It was a Sunday so I went to church, chilled for a bit and then
            I was on my way to her house. I got there at around 12:30. Once I arrived, we got straight to work. We both got our supplies
            and  photos and started creating. This year, I printed out pictures of my actual goals instead of just inspirational words or 
            photos of people. While we were making it, Sharmin's mom finished cooking lunch and she wanted us to eat it while it was hot so 
            we paused everything and went to eat. While we ate, Sharmin and I watched The Vampire Diaries because that was the show I was
            currently watching and Sharmin had already watched it. When we were done eating we got back to working on our vision boards. There
            wasn't that much work left to do since we had already formatted everything. After that, we played some games and chilled. Then my 
            dad came and picked me up. It was a fun and calm day.  </p>

            <p> Earlier this week, I was randomly chosen by CUNY to get covid tested. I had to get tested at a CUNY site so that it 
                would automatically be uploaded to my CUNY profile. Brooklyn College does testing on Saturdays and they open at 9am so
                to avoid lines, I went for 10am. It was a very smooth and fast process. When that was done I walked to the Q train station.
                I took the uptown Q train to newkirk plaza where Sharmin was supposed to hop on my train. She was late so I got off the train
                and waited for her in the train station. </p>

                <p>When Sharmin arrived, we hopped on the Q train and took it to Times Square. First we 
                went to H&M because it was the first store we saw as soon as we came out of the train station. We walked around a bit but they
                didn't really have anything good. Then we made our way to <a href="https://www.bookoffusa.com/">BOOKOFF</a>, which was the bookstore that we had originally planned to go to. 
                BOOKOFF is primarily a bookstore but they also sell pop figures, electronics, DVDs, CDs, and so much more. We spent about 2 hours in 
                the store just browsing through book trying to find good ones. To be honest, it's such a cool store and a lot of the books are super 
                cheap and in great condition!! After we were done there, we went to Forever 21 and surprisingly they had buy one get one free on all sale 
                items. They had pretty nice stuff and for great prices, so we each picked up a couple things. Then went back to the train station and were on our
                way home. We hadn't went out in such a long time so it was a great day and worth it for all the things we got.
