        <p>Sharmin and I have a tradition where we always do something on the day after Christmas. Last year we made vision boards
            and we really like it so this year we decided to continue. It was a Sunday so I went to church, chilled for a bit and then
            I was on my way to her house. I got there at around 12:30. Once I arrived, we got straight to work. We both got our supplies
            and  photos and started creating. This year, I printed out pictures of my actual goals instead of just inspirational words or 
            photos of people. While we were making it, Sharmin's mom finished cooking lunch and she wanted us to eat it while it was hot so 
            we paused everything and went to eat. While we ate, Sharmin and I watched The Vampire Diaries because that was the show I was
            currently watching and Sharmin had already watched it. When we were done eating we got back to working on our vision boards. There
            wasn't that much work left to do since we had already formatted everything. After that, we played some games and chilled. Then my 
            dad came and picked me up. It was a fun and calm day.  </p>
