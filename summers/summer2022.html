            <h3>May 27<sup>th</sup> - May 31<sup>st</sup></h3>
            <p>During these 5 days, Sharmin and I decided to take a trip to Washington DC. It was our first trip together.
                We took the Amtrak train and it was a 3 and a half hour ride.

        <p>Today was our departure day. Our train was leaving at 7:05 am so we planned to get to Moyinhan train station
            about an hour before. I got to Sharmin's house at around 5:30 and then from there me, her, and her brother took the 
            Q train to penn station. We walked to Moyinhan station from there. We saw our train on the board and everything was on 
            time so that was good. We waited at our gate and once we got on line to board the train, Sharmin's brother left us. The train
            ride was nice and smooth and unproblematic. Once we got to Union Station in DC, our first stop was to find food. We had to kill
            time because it was too early to check into the Airbnb and we were hungry. We found this crepes place in the station. It looked good
            but I was not a fan of the food at all. Then we went to Walgreens to buy some snacks and necessities. I must say, Union Station
            is hyped up very much but I truly disliked it when we were there, everything was organized poorly. Once we exited the station, Sharmin
            called an Uber to drop us off at the Airbnb. Literally as soon as we got there and exited the Uber, it started pouring and my phone died. It
            was not it. We got in successfully though and all was well. The Airbnb was really cute and nice. The host was very considerate and left a
            lot of things for us to use. Later that day when we got settled in, we took an Uber to the National Gallery of Art. The gallery was nice 
            but to be honest, nothing really stood out to me. We went outside to get some bubble tea which tasted amazing because it was 
            extremely sweet and then we walked around the outdoors gallery of art. After that we walked to L'Enfant Plaza to get food. We went to 
            Falafel Inc. and let me tell you, the falafel bowl that I got was the best thing I ever ate in my life. I need to try falafel more often.
            After that we got donuts and called an Uber to go back home. It was a long day but actually a really good and successful first day in DC.

        <p>On this day we planned to go to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park (aka the zoo LOL) and the United States botanical 
            garden. We woke up early and decided that were going to learn how to take the Metro instead of taking Ubers all the time. 
            We got to the train station which was just like an 8 minute walk away and we walked the person in the booth what we had to do.
            We had to go to a kiosk and buy a metrocard (which never expires) and then put money on it. Rides are $2 so we payed $2 for the 
            card and then put $2 on it. We took the blue train from Stadium-Armory Station 8 stops to Metro Center. There we transferred to the 
            red line where we rode for 3 stops to Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan Station. From there it was about a 10 minute walk to the zoo. The 
            metro was very easy to figure out and signs in the station were informative. Once we got the zoo, I bought a map and we were on our way.
            We went through every path the zoo had and we saw some amazing animals. I loved it so much and it was my favorite part of the trip. We 
            spent a really long time in the zoo and walked a lot so afterwards, we went to a restaurant named LiLLies for food. Their food was good 
            and I actually like the restaurant, it wasn't too boring but not too fancy either. After that, we took the train to the Botanical Garden.
            It was quite a walk out of train station but it was all good. To be honest, the garden was not what I expected at all. There was just 
            a lot of plants and a green house but there was barely any flowers or colorful plants. Once we were done at the garden, we took the bus home.
            It was pretty early so at home we chilled for a bit, showered and decided to go out for food later. We kept it simple and went to a nearby 
            Chinese store. We brought the food home and watched the movie Big Time Adolescence on Hulu. Overall it was a well spent day and I loved the zoo.

        <p>Today the plan was to go to Georgetown Park and Washington Harbour. Georgetown is supposed to be pretty and have a lot of stores but 
            boy was I disappointed. We took the train there but once again, we had to walk a lot from the train station to get to the stores so 
            our first stop was getting breakfast. While walking to Georgetown park we found a cute stop named PAUL Franklin Square. It's a 
            French store so they had a lot of baguettes and croissants. I got a croissant and Sharmin got an omelette. When we were finished, we continued 
            walking to Georgetown park. Once we got there, we was that it was nothing we expected. First of all it was super busy and it was tourist central. 
            Secondly, there were a lot of stores but to me, the stores were useless and it wasn't like an actual mall. It was more of an outdoor, "zip in and out"
            mall instead of an indoor mall. It was pretty weird to us and did not make any sense so we ditched that plan and decided to go to the White House. We
            hopped on the bus and surprisingly it dropped us like 2 minutes away. The White House was not as grand as I hoped it'd be LOL. It was gated obviously
            but it was also just a house that was white and had very minimal architectural effort. Also the circle flower garden they had in front was not centered 
            and it triggered me very much. We took a lot of photos though, and I even got a photo with a secret service agent! We sat and chilled for a bit until we were
            on our way to find food. We planned to go to the National Portrait Museum after the White House so we took the bus there and found food nearby. We went to
            Matchbox which is a pizza restaurant. I got pasta and Sharmin got pizza, and we both got mocktails (~fancy~). The Portrait Museum was really nice to me. I 
            am not the type of person to see the deeper meanings of art or be able to sit and actually study it but this museum had some amazing pieces. They were truly
            intriguing and I spent some time looking at and reading about several of them. One of the pieces even made Sharmin emotional. We spent a lot of time there and
            and once it started getting late, we planned to go to the Lincoln Memorial and see the sunset. We waited for the bus for quite a while and none came so we called an
            Uber. Once we got there, we bought ice creams from the truck and made our way to the top of the memorial. We got there just in time and the view of the sunset was 
            absolutely gorgeous. We walked to the train station to be on our way home and it was a nice calm ride on the train. However, when we got off, it was pitch black
            outside and it was a bit scary. Even though we knew where we were going, we were still two young women in a foreign place. We got home safely though and it was all good.
