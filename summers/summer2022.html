            <h3>May 27<sup>th</sup> - May 31<sup>st</sup></h3>
            <p>During these 5 days, Sharmin and I decided to take a trip to Washington DC. It was our first trip together.
                We took the Amtrak train and it was a 3 and a half hour ride.

        <p>Today was our departure day. Our train was leaving at 7:05 am so we planned to get to Moyinhan train station
            about an hour before. I got to Sharmin's house at around 5:30 and then from there me, her, and her brother took the 
            Q train to Penn station. We walked to Moyinhan station from there. We saw our train on the board and everything was on 
            time so that was good. We waited at our gate and once we got on line to board the train, Sharmin's brother left us. The train
            ride was nice and smooth and unproblematic. Once we got to Union Station in DC, our first stop was to find food. We had to kill
            time because it was too early to check into the Airbnb and we were hungry. We found this crepes place in the station. It looked good
            but I was not a fan of the food at all. Then we went to Walgreens to buy some snacks and necessities. I must say, Union Station
            is hyped up very much but I truly disliked it when we were there, everything was organized poorly. Once we exited the station, Sharmin
            called an Uber to drop us off at the Airbnb. Literally as soon as we got there and exited the Uber, it started pouring and my phone died. It
            was not it. We got in successfully though and all was well. The Airbnb was really cute and nice. The host was very considerate and left a
            lot of things for us to use. Later that day when we got settled in, we took an Uber to the <a href="https://www.nga.gov/">National Gallery of Art</a>. The gallery was nice 
            but to be honest, nothing really stood out to me. We went outside to get some bubble tea which tasted amazing because it was 
            extremely sweet and then we walked around the outdoors gallery of art. After that we walked to <a href="https://www.lenfantplaza.com/">L'Enfant Plaza</a> to get food. We went to 
            <a href="https://www.falafelinc.org/">Falafel Inc.</a> and let me tell you, the falafel bowl that I got was the best thing I ever ate in my life. I need to try falafel more often.
            After that we got donuts and called an Uber to go back home. It was a long day but actually a really good and successful first day in DC.

        <p>On this day we planned to go to the <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/">Smithsonian National Zoological Park</a> (aka the zoo LOL) and the United States botanical 
            garden. We woke up early and decided that were going to learn how to take the Metro instead of taking Ubers all the time. 
            We got to the train station which was just like an 8 minute walk away and we walked the person in the booth what we had to do.
            We had to go to a kiosk and buy a metrocard (which never expires) and then put money on it. Rides are $2 so we payed $2 for the 
            card and then put $2 on it. We took the blue train from Stadium-Armory Station 8 stops to Metro Center. There we transferred to the 
            red line where we rode for 3 stops to Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan Station. From there it was about a 10 minute walk to the zoo. The 
            metro was very easy to figure out and signs in the station were informative. Once we got the zoo, I bought a map and we were on our way.
            We went through every path the zoo had and we saw some amazing animals. I loved it so much and it was my favorite part of the trip. We 
            spent a really long time in the zoo and walked a lot so afterwards, we went to a restaurant named <a href="https://www.lilliesrestaurant.com/">LiLLies</a> for food. Their food was good 
            and I actually like the restaurant, it wasn't too boring but not too fancy either. After that, we took the train to the <a href="https://www.usbg.gov/">United States Botanical Garden</a>.
            It was quite a walk out of train station but it was all good. To be honest, the garden was not what I expected at all. There was just 
            a lot of plants and a green house but there was barely any flowers or colorful plants. Once we were done at the garden, we took the bus home.
            It was pretty early so at home we chilled for a bit, showered and decided to go out for food later. We kept it simple and went to a nearby 
            Chinese store. We brought the food home and watched the movie Big Time Adolescence on Hulu. Overall it was a well spent day and I loved the zoo.

        <p>Today the plan was to go to <a href="https://www.georgetownpark.com/">Georgetown Park</a>  and <a href="https://thewashingtonharbour.com/">Washington Harbour</a>. 
            Georgetown is supposed to be pretty and have a lot of stores but 
            boy was I disappointed. We took the train there but once again, we had to walk a lot from the train station to get to the stores so 
            our first stop was getting breakfast. While walking to Georgetown park we found a cute stop named <a href="https://www.pauldmv.com/">PAUL Franklin Square</a>. It's a 
            French store so they had a lot of baguettes and croissants. I got a croissant and Sharmin got an omelette. When we were finished, we continued 
            walking to Georgetown park. Once we got there, we was that it was nothing we expected. First of all it was super busy and it was tourist central. 
            Secondly, there were a lot of stores but to me, the stores were useless and it wasn't like an actual mall. It was more of an outdoor, "zip in and out"
            mall instead of an indoor mall. It was pretty weird to us and did not make any sense so we ditched that plan and decided to go to the White House. We
            hopped on the bus and surprisingly it dropped us like 2 minutes away. The White House was not as grand as I hoped it'd be LOL. It was gated obviously
            but it was also just a house that was white and had very minimal architectural effort. Also the circle flower garden they had in front was not centered 
            and it triggered me very much. We took a lot of photos though, and I even got a photo with a secret service agent! We sat and chilled for a bit until we were
            on our way to find food. We planned to go to the <a href="https://npg.si.edu/home/national-portrait-gallery">National Portrait Museum</a> after the White House so we took the bus there and found food nearby. We went to
            <a href="https://www.matchboxrestaurants.com/">matchbox</a> which is a pizza restaurant. I got pasta and Sharmin got pizza, and we both got mocktails (~fancy~). The Portrait Museum was really nice to me. I 
            am not the type of person to see the deeper meanings of art or be able to sit and actually study it but this museum had some amazing pieces. They were truly
            intriguing and I spent some time looking at and reading about several of them. One of the pieces even made Sharmin emotional. We spent a lot of time there and
            and once it started getting late, we planned to go to the Lincoln Memorial and see the sunset. We waited for the bus for quite a while and none came so we called an
            Uber. Once we got there, we bought ice creams from the truck and made our way to the top of the memorial. We got there just in time and the view of the sunset was 
            absolutely gorgeous. We walked to the train station to be on our way home and it was a nice calm ride on the train. However, when we got off, it was pitch black
            outside and it was a bit scary. Even though we knew where we were going, we were still two young women in a foreign place. We got home safely though and it was all good.

        <p>Today was Memorial Day so it was the perfect day to go see the Capitol. We woke up pretty early, and took
            the train to the Capitol. I actually really like the Capitol and all of its architecture. We took some pictures
            outside of it. Our plan was to go inside the Capitol and get a tour but apparently we need to book a reservation in 
            advance. We tried booking it then and there but it was all filled up. We wanted to go to the Supreme Court afterwards,
            but it was closed for some reason. We ended up going to the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a> instead. We got tickets on the spot and got
            to go inside and roam the library. It was actually a really interesting library and there were some cool books. Our next stop
            was back to L'Enfant Plaza. The last time we went there, we saw big tour buses that drove you all around D.C. and explained all
            of it. The buses that we saw said they were free for that weekend but when we got to L'Enfant Plaza, we didn't see those buses
            anymore. We ended up getting food there though. I got the falafel bowl from before because it was extremely good and Sharmin got 
            Shake Shack. Since the day was nowhere close to being over, we decided to go to the <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/">Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History</a>.
            While getting there, we saw the Memorial Day parade. I must say, going to the museum was in in the moment decision, but I really loved it.
            There were so many animal figures and cool exhibits like gems and minerals and evolution. It was a huge museum and we explored all of it. Once 
            we were done, we were on our way home. We took one last stop to 7-Eleven to get slushies because it a super hot day and we did a lot of walking.
            We chilled for the rest of the day and ate chinese food leftovers while watching Booksmart on Hulu. It was a long, hot day, but we made
            the most of it.   </p>

        <p>This was our last day in D.C. We didn't have much planned. We had to check out of the Airbnb by 11 am so we woke up
            early and started getting ready. We cleaned up and got everything together so we were out of the room by 10:30. We took
            the bus to Union Station where we planned to spend the entire day until our ride back which was leaving at 4:55 pm. Once we 
            hopped out of the bus, we looked for breakfast. We found <a href="https://cornerbakerycafe.com/">Corner Bakery</a> where I got 4 buttermilk pancakes with eggs and bacon
            and Sharmin got buttermilk pancakes. Their breakfast was super duper good, I must say. Then we finally entered Union Station and
            went to Union General where we got souvenirs. We both had to get souvenirs for quite a lot of people so we spent a lot of time there.
            We had nothing else planned for the day so we just walked around for a bit and then sat at the gate. We pretty much just chilled 
            and got Jamba Juice for rest of the time. We checked the screen periodically for updates on the ride back to see if we were going to be 
            delayed and what track we would be on and I swear, they waited until complete LAST SECOND to say anything. There was absolutely
            no updates all day long until like around 4:50 when it finally showed the track and said "boarding" so we had to scram. Crazy. Typical New 
            York. The train ride back had some delays so we ended up arriving back in NYC at around 9 pm instead of like 8:30. I took the MTA home and 
            got home safe at around 10:30. It was like 5 straight hours of overall train travel through states and the city but we made it.

        <p> This day was my 3<sup>rd</sup> date with Justin. On our past two dates, he came to the city for me so this time I decided to 
            go to Staten Island for him. It was my first time taking the Staten Island ferry to get to the island. Most times, I just take
            the Verrazano bridge. Not going to lie, I was a bit scared to take the boat. I'm not the biggest fan of water and I don't like being 
            smack in the middle of it and not seeing any land. While getting on the boat, I kept giving myself pep talks and told myself it's all
            going to be okay. To be honest, the boat ride was not bad at all. I went to the lower level so I didn't have a clear view of the water. 
            It didn't feel like a boat at all too, it felt like I was in a huge car. Once I got to the island, Justin was there waiting for. He planned
            for us to live a day in his childhood. He brought me to see his childhood home and then we spent the day at <a href="https://snug-harbor.org/">Snug Harbor</a>, his childhood park.
            He spent a lot of time there when he was younger so he had every single part of it memorized. We walked around and then we found a nice, quiet
            spot for a picnic. He made chips and guac and his childhood sandwich for us. I brought small canvases and paint so we painted for each other. Really,
            really cute. We layed down, chilled, and chatted for the rest of the day. It was super peaceful and stress-free. Staten Island in general is pretty 
            peaceful. Once the sun started to set, we went back to the terminal to catch the ferry. He took the ferry back to the city with me and dropped me off 
            at the train. It was pretty sad when we had to accept that the day was over. I hopped on the train and he hopped on the next ferry back. It was an 
            amazing day and Staten Island is not that bad after all.
